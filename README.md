## CS445: Artificial Intelligence

**Quick Note:** Some of these projects have zip files included, these exist to run the pacman game or hold the multitude of files needed to run what I was working on (provided by Professor Gupta). If you choose to look at what I have done/ run the autograder, feel free to unzip. The other files within each directory include code that I have written to accomplish a specific task. Said tasks are outlines within the project descriptions also included within each directory!
